#CS2106Lab1

This course assumes that you have basic knowledge of C programming, and this lab will build
on those basics to introduce you to some intermediate and advanced topics, including
dividing your work up into multiple source files, creating pointers to functions, and using
dynamic memory to create arbitrarily large data structures (subject to available memory).
